In computing, a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. 
Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.

**PIVOT** relational operator converts data from row level to column level. PIVOT rotates a table-valued expression by turning the unique
values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output. Using PIVOT operator, we can perform aggregate operation 
where we need them.

**Aggregation** operators perform mathematical operations like Average, Aggregate, Count, Max, Min and Sum, on the numeric property of the 
elements in the collection.
